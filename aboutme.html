      <p class="about-me">
        My story in pursuing a tech career began in March of 2020. As COVID-19
        began spreading nationally, the governmental shut down left me without a
        job. During this time, I did a lot of self-reflecting. I knew I wasn't
        happy in my previous career and decided the best thing for me was to
        attempt a career change. I knew the only way for this to be possible,
        and even remotely successful, was to go back to school. Here I was,
        about to start all over. The feeling of apprehension and self-doubt
        lingered at the thought of such a drastic undertaking. However, I knew I
        was going to try my best at this very important transitional chapter of
        my life. I took the leap of faith.

        During my journey in my Master's program, I became educated in
        Statistics, Business Intelligence through Analytics, Database
        Management, Optimization Methodologies, Data Visualization, Business
        Processes for Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data Management.
        Additionally, my Microsoft Excel skills improved drastically. But more
        importanly, I developed a passion for data and improving businesses
        through the help of analytics!

        expenses, or to simply understand characteristics of the business from

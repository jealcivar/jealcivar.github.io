          <div class="project-description">
            This project utilized text scraping methodologies to classify a
            dataset of text messages as either Spam or Not Spam. The
            models/algorithms used were Regression, Recurrent Neural Networks,
            Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder
            Representations from Transformers (BERT). These models were used to
            predict Spam/Not Spam messages and the best model was recommended.

            This project ran on the PySpark interface (Apache Spark in Python).
            The purpose of this project was to predict the severity of tumors on
            a binary level (malignant or benign) based on several physical
            characteristics. Data cleaning was executed and data visuals were
            produced for business intelligence. Machine Learning accuracy
            metrics were observed for predictive value.

            challenge visualized the eviction rates in San Francisco, CA from
            1996 to mid-2019. The data was filtered by neighborhood which was
            captured by Longitude and Latitude coordinates that were given. The
            amount of evictions are represented by intensity of hue.

            This visual shows average delay times by airline throughout the
            nation (separated by state). The color scheme is as follows: dark
            blue means very little delay, while dark red means high delay times.
            We can see that customers in Illinois must be pretty upset!
